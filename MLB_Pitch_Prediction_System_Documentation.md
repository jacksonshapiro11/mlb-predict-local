## Model Architecture

### Two-Head LightGBM Design

Our system employs a sophisticated two-head architecture where predictions from the first model inform the second model:

#### Head A: Pitch Type Classification

**Objective**: Predict the type of pitch that will be thrown

**Target Variable**: `pitch_type_can` (canonicalized pitch types)

**Classes** (9 total):
- `FF`: Four-seam Fastball
- `SI`: Sinker/Two-seam Fastball  
- `FC`: Cutter
- `SL`: Slider
- `CU`: Curveball
- `CH`: Changeup
- `FS`: Splitter
- `KC`: Knuckle Curve
- `OTHER`: All other pitch types

**Model Type**: Multi-class classification using LightGBM
- **Objective**: `multiclass`
- **Metric**: `multi_logloss`
- **Output**: Probability distribution over 9 pitch types

#### Head B: Expected wOBA Regression

**Objective**: Predict the expected weighted on-base average for the pitch

**Target Variable**: `estimated_woba_using_speedangle`

**Enhanced Features**: All Head A features PLUS pitch type probabilities from Head A
- `PT_PROB_FF`: Probability this pitch is a fastball
- `PT_PROB_SL`: Probability this pitch is a slider
- *[9 probability features from Head A]*

**Model Type**: Regression using LightGBM
- **Objective**: `regression`
- **Metric**: `rmse`
- **Output**: Continuous xwOBA value (typically 0.000 - 2.000)

### Model Hyperparameters

**Pitch Type Model (Head A)**:
```python
params_pt = {
    'objective': 'multiclass',
    'num_class': 9,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'num_leaves': 256,
    'max_depth': -1,
    'feature_fraction': 0.9,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.9,
    'bagging_freq': 5,
    'metric': 'multi_logloss',
    'verbose': -1
}
```

**xwOBA Model (Head B)**:
```python
params_xwoba = {
    'objective': 'regression',
    'metric': 'rmse',
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'num_leaves': 512,
    'max_depth': -1,
    'feature_fraction': 0.95,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_freq': 5,
    'verbose': -1
}
```

### Temporal Weighting Strategy

**Time-Decay Weighting**: Recent data is weighted more heavily than older data
- **Lambda (λ)**: 0.0012 per day
- **Half-life**: ~577 days (approximately 2 seasons)
- **Weight Formula**: `w = exp(-λ × days_since_latest)`

**Rationale**: 
- Player performance evolves over time
- Recent form is more predictive than distant history
- Accounts for player development, aging, injury recovery
- Balances recency with sufficient historical context

## Feature Selection & Data Leakage Prevention

### Data Leakage Analysis

**Critical Challenge**: Distinguishing between legitimate predictive features and data leakage

#### Features REMOVED (Data Leakage):

**1. Current Pitch Measurements** (27 features):
- **Physics**: `release_speed`, `release_spin_rate`, `pfx_x`, `pfx_z`
- **Location**: `plate_x`, `plate_z`, `zone`
- **Trajectory**: `vx0`, `vy0`, `vz0`, `ax`, `ay`, `az`
- **Strike Zone**: `sz_top`, `sz_bot`
- **Rationale**: These measure the current pitch being predicted

**2. Current Pitch Outcomes** (8 features):
- **Contact**: `launch_speed`, `launch_angle`, `hit_distance_sc`
- **Location**: `hc_x`, `hc_y` (hit coordinates)
- **Results**: `events`, `description`
- **Value**: `delta_run_exp`, `delta_home_win_exp`
- **Rationale**: These are consequences of the pitch, not predictors

#### Features KEPT (Legitimate Predictors):

**1. Historical Pitch-Type Statistics** (45 features):
- `USAGE_30_FF`: "This pitcher throws fastballs 60% of the time"
- `V_TD_SL`: "His slider averages 87 mph historically"
- `WHIFF_30_CU`: "Batters whiff on his curveball 35% of the time"
- **Rationale**: Known tendencies available before pitch

**2. Historical xwOBA Performance** (18 features):
- `XWOBA_30_VS_L`: "This pitcher allows .350 xwOBA vs lefties"
- `XWOBA_TD_FF`: "This batter has .280 xwOBA vs fastballs career"
- **Rationale**: Past performance, not current pitch outcome

**3. Game Situation** (44 features):
- Count, inning, score, baserunners, win probability
- **Rationale**: Observable before pitch is thrown

### Feature Validation Process

**1. Temporal Logic Test**: Is this information available before the pitch?
**2. Causality Test**: Does this feature cause the outcome or result from it?
**3. Historical vs Current Test**: Does this measure past performance or current pitch?
