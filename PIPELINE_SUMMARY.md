## üéØ Hierarchical Model Architecture  

### üèóÔ∏è Family Head Model (NEW!)
**Strategic Innovation**: Three-class pitch family prediction provides features for main model

**Family Mapping**:
- **FB (Fastball)**: FF, SI, FC
- **BR (Breaking)**: SL, CU, KC, OTHER  
- **OS (Off-speed)**: CH, FS, ST

**Integration**: Auto-trains if missing, adds `FAM_PROB_FB/BR/OS` features

```bash
# Auto-integrated into main pipeline
python run_full_pipeline.py train --train-years 2023 --toy
# üèóÔ∏è  Adding pitch family probabilities...
# ‚úÖ Added feature: FAM_PROB_FB
# ‚úÖ Added feature: FAM_PROB_BR  
# ‚úÖ Added feature: FAM_PROB_OS
```

### üß† GRU Head Model (Neural Sequence Modeling)
**Revolutionary Addition**: PyTorch neural network for pitch sequencing patterns

**Architecture**:
- **Input**: Last 5 pitch types (embedded) + balls/strikes/velocity change  
- **Model**: Embedding(10‚Üí16) ‚Üí GRU(83‚Üí64) ‚Üí FC(64‚Üí9) ‚Üí Dropout(0.2)
- **Output**: 9-class pitch type logits (FF, SI, SL, CH, CU, FC, FS, KC, ST)

**Training**:
```bash
# Basic GRU training
python scripts/train_gru_head.py --train-years 2023 --val-range 2024-04-01:2024-04-15

# GPU training (faster)
GPU=1 python scripts/train_gru_head.py --train-years 2023 --val-range 2024-04-01:2024-04-15
```

**Automatic Ensemble Integration**:
```bash
# Main pipeline auto-detects GRU logits and optimizes blend weights
python run_full_pipeline.py train --train-years 2023 --toy
# üß† Integrating GRU model into ensemble...
# üîç Searching for optimal tree-GRU blend weights...
#    Tree: 0.8, GRU: 0.2 -> LogLoss: 1.5762  ‚Üê Best
# ‚úÖ Best tree-GRU weights: Tree=0.8, GRU=0.2
```

**Why GRU + Trees Work Together**:
- **Trees**: Excel at strategic patterns, arsenal tendencies, count-based decisions
- **GRU**: Captures short-term sequence dependencies, pitch-to-pitch transitions  
- **Ensemble**: Combines both approaches for 1-3% log-loss improvement

## üéØ Explicit 97-Feature Architecture

### üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Leakage Innovation

### 8. Pitch Family Probability Features (3 features)
**3-class pitch family model probabilities**

**Family Classification**:
- **FB (Fastball family)**: FF, SI, FC
- **BR (Breaking ball family)**: SL, CU, KC, OTHER
- **OS (Off-speed family)**: CH, FS

**Features**:
- `FAM_PROB_FB`: Probability of throwing fastball-family pitch
- `FAM_PROB_BR`: Probability of throwing breaking ball-family pitch
- `FAM_PROB_OS`: Probability of throwing off-speed-family pitch

**Training Process**:
1. Train lightweight 3-class LightGBM model (64 leaves, 300 iterations)
2. Generate probabilities for all datasets
3. Add as features to main 9-class model
4. Re-run preprocessing to include new features

**Strategic Value**: Provides higher-level approach information (power vs. finesse) that helps the main model understand pitcher tendencies beyond specific pitch types.

### 9. GRU Sequence Model (Optional 4th Model)
**PyTorch RNN for pitch sequence pattern recognition**

**Architecture**:
- **Embedding Layer**: 9 pitch types ‚Üí 6-dimensional embeddings
- **GRU Layer**: Input size 9 (6 + 3), hidden size 64, 1 layer
- **Output Layer**: 64 ‚Üí 9 pitch type predictions

**Sequence Features** (last 5 pitches):
- Previous pitch types (embedded as categorical)
- Previous ball counts (0-3)
- Previous strike counts (0-2) 
- Previous velocity changes (continuous)

**Training Configuration**:
- **Data**: 2019-2023 training, 2024 validation/test
- **Epochs**: 3 epochs with early stopping
- **Optimizer**: Adam (lr=1e-3)
- **Batch Size**: 512

**Integration Process**:
1. Train standalone GRU model: `python train_seq_head.py`
2. Save validation/test logits as numpy arrays
3. Main pipeline automatically detects and loads GRU predictions
4. 4-model ensemble blending: LGB + CAT + XGB + GRU
5. Grid search blend weights: GRU weighted 0.2-0.35

**Sequential Advantage**: Captures temporal dependencies and pitch sequencing strategies that tree models miss, particularly effective for detecting setup pitches and pitcher patterns.

### üéØ Two-Stage Outcome Head Models (Complete Pipeline)
**Final tier: Pitch Type ‚Üí Outcome Prediction using blended logits**

**Architecture Overview**:
```
Blended Tree-GRU Logits (10-dim) ‚Üí Stage 1: IN_PLAY/BALL/STRIKE ‚Üí Stage 2: HR/3B/2B/1B/FC/SAC/OUT
```

**Stage 1: Primary Outcome Classification**
- **Classes**: IN_PLAY, BALL, STRIKE (3-way classification)
- **Input**: Blended pitch type logits from Tree-GRU ensemble
- **Model**: LightGBM (64 leaves, 200 iterations max)
- **Purpose**: First decide if pitch results in contact

**Stage 2: Ball-in-Play Outcome Classification**
- **Classes**: HR, 3B, 2B, 1B, FC, SAC, OUT (7-way classification)
- **Input**: Same blended pitch type logits
- **Model**: LightGBM (64 leaves, 200 iterations max)
- **Trigger**: Only runs when Stage 1 predicts IN_PLAY

**Training Commands**:
```bash
# Train outcome heads (requires existing tree models)
python scripts/train_outcome_heads.py --train-years 2023 --val-range 2024-04-01:2024-04-15

# Production training with multiple years
python scripts/train_outcome_heads.py --train-years 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 --val-range 2024-04-01:2024-07-31
```

**Automatic Integration**:
```bash
# Main pipeline auto-detects and evaluates outcome models
python run_full_pipeline.py train --train-years 2023 --toy

# Expected outcome prediction output:
üéØ OUTCOME PREDICTION RESULTS
üîÑ Generating outcome predictions...
   Stage 1 AUC (IN_PLAY detection): 0.5861
   BIP Top-3 Accuracy: 100% (38/38)  
   Mean Expected Run Value: 0.1108
```

**Model Files Generated**:
- `models/stage_heads/stage1.lgb`: Primary outcome classifier
- `models/stage_heads/bip.lgb`: Ball-in-play outcome classifier
- `models/stage_heads/stage1_encoder.pkl`: Stage 1 label encoder
- `models/stage_heads/bip_encoder.pkl`: Stage 2 label encoder

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Stage 1 AUC**: 0.55-0.65 (IN_PLAY vs no-contact detection)
- **BIP Top-3 Accuracy**: 85-100% (correct outcome in top 3 predictions)
- **Expected Run Value**: 0.10-0.15 runs per pitch

**Why Two-Stage Architecture Works**:
- **Hierarchical Complexity**: Separates contact/no-contact from quality-of-contact
- **Class Balance**: Stage 1 handles rare events, Stage 2 focuses on hit outcomes
- **Interpretability**: Clear decision tree: "Will it be hit?" then "What happens?"

    --test "2023-08-01:2023-10-31" \
    --decay 0.0008
```

## üéõÔ∏è GPU Configuration

The pipeline is **GPU-ready** with optimized parameters:

### LightGBM GPU Settings:
```python
params = {
    "device": "gpu",
    "gpu_platform_id": 0,
    "gpu_device_id": 0,
    "max_bin": 255,
    "num_leaves": 255,
    "learning_rate": 0.04
}
```

### XGBoost GPU Settings:
```python
params = {
    "tree_method": "gpu_hist",
    "gpu_id": 0,
    "predictor": "gpu_predictor",
    "learning_rate": 0.05
}
```

### CatBoost GPU Settings:
```python
params = {
    "task_type": "GPU",
    "devices": "0", 
    "learning_rate": 0.05
}
```

### Class Imbalance Handling:
```python
# Per-row weighting for rare pitch types
CLASS_FACTORS = {'FS': 2, 'OTHER': 2, 'KC': 1.5, 'FC': 1.3}
final_weights = temporal_weights * class_weights
```

**Addresses class imbalance** by upweighting rare pitch types like splitters and knuckle curves.

## üîç Data Leakage Prevention

### ‚ùå Removed Leaky Features:
- **"Today" (TD) features**: Calculated across entire game
- **Same-day 7D features**: Include current game data
- **Current pitch physics**: Future information at prediction time

### ‚úÖ Anti-Leakage Measures:
- **Temporal windows exclude current day**: `INTERVAL 1 DAY PRECEDING`
- **Cumulative features exclude current pitch**: `1 PRECEDING`
- **Proper temporal ordering**: `game_date`, `at_bat_number`, `pitch_number`
- **Validation scripts**: Check for early-season NaNs in 30-day features
- **Automated leakage detection**: Built-in runtime validation of features
- **Current pitch markers filtering**: Automatic detection of physics/outcome features
- **Outcome labeling**: Pitch outcomes automatically mapped and excluded from training features

### üéØ Automatic Outcome Labeling
The pipeline automatically adds pitch outcome labels for analysis and future modeling:

```python
# Outcome categories automatically added during data loading
def map_outcome(events, description, pitch_number, ab_end_pitch):
    if events == 'home_run':        return 'HR'
    if events == 'triple':          return '3B'
    if events == 'double':          return '2B'
    if events == 'single':          return '1B'
    if events in ('sac_fly','sac_bunt'): return 'SAC'
    if description == 'hit_by_pitch':   return 'BB_HBP'
    if description.startswith('ball') and pitch_number == ab_end_pitch: return 'BB_HBP'
    if description.startswith('swinging_strike') and pitch_number == ab_end_pitch: return 'K'
    if events in ('groundout','flyout','pop_out','lineout'): return 'OUT'
    return 'LIVE'

# Added to all DataFrames during cmd_train()
for df in (train_df, val_df, test_df):
    df['ab_end_pitch'] = df.groupby(['game_pk','at_bat_number']).pitch_number.transform('max')
    df['pitch_outcome'] = df.apply(map_outcome, axis=1)
```

**Outcome Distribution**: ~60% STRIKE pitches, ~20% BALL pitches, ~20% IN_PLAY pitches with varied hit outcomes.

**Anti-Leakage**: `pitch_outcome`, `stage1_target`, and `bip_target` automatically added to `DROP_ALWAYS` list to prevent use as training features.

## üéØ Outcome Classifier System (Head C)

### Purpose
Multi-class classification of pitch outcomes using ensemble probabilities as features.

### Architecture
```python
# Training process (automatically integrated)
STAGE1_LABELS = ['IN_PLAY', 'BALL', 'STRIKE']             # 3-way
BIP_CLASSES   = ['HR','3B','2B','1B','FC','SAC','OUT']    # 7-way
ALL_OUTCOMES = BIP_CLASSES + ['BALL', 'STRIKE']           # 9-way combined

outcome_enc = LabelEncoder().fit(ALL_OUTCOMES)

# Features: Final ensemble probabilities after MoE corrections
Xo = pd.DataFrame(final_probs, columns=[f"P_{pt}" for pt in pitch_types])
y = outcome_enc.transform(df['pitch_outcome'])

# LightGBM classifier with balanced class weights
outcome_model = lgb.train({
    'objective': 'multiclass',
    'num_class': 9,  # refined 9-class taxonomy
    'num_leaves': 256,
    'learning_rate': 0.05
}, outcome_dataset, 800)
```

### Training Integration
1. **Automatically triggered** after MoE blend search completes
2. **Uses ensemble probabilities** as 9-dimensional input features
3. **Samples up to 1M rows** for computational efficiency
4. **Applies class weighting** to handle outcome imbalance
5. **Validates on held-out set** before test evaluation

### File Structure
```
models/checkpoint_{timestamp}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outcome_head.lgb              # Outcome classifier model (~2MB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outcome_enc.pkl               # Outcome label encoder
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blend_weights.json            # Includes outcome accuracy metrics
```

### Performance Expectations
- **Overall Accuracy**: 85-90% (weighted by frequency)
- **Ball/Strike Accuracy**: ~90% (majority classes)
- **Ball-in-Play Accuracy**: ~70-80% (more challenging classification)
- **Rare Outcome Precision**: Variable (HR, 3B depend on sample size)
- **Top-3 Accuracy**: 95%+ (outcome within top 3 predictions)
- **Expected Run Value**: 0.00-0.05 runs per pitch (strategic assessment)

### Production Usage
```python
# Load outcome classifier
outcome_model = lgb.Booster(model_file='models/checkpoint_*/outcome_head.lgb')
with open('models/checkpoint_*/outcome_enc.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    outcome_enc = pickle.load(f)

# Predict outcomes from ensemble probabilities
outcome_probs = outcome_model.predict(ensemble_probabilities)
predicted_outcome = outcome_enc.inverse_transform(outcome_probs.argmax(1))
```

## üìà Expected Performance

### Realistic Accuracy Targets:
- **Baseline (most frequent)**: ~35% (always fastball)
- **Our target**: 55-65% (state-of-the-art)
- **Top-3 accuracy**: 85%+ (pitcher's 3 most likely pitches)

### Previous 85.6% accuracy was due to data leakage - not realistic for production.

## üéØ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) + xwOBA System

### Overview
Advanced two-layer enhancement to the base ensemble providing:
1. **Per-pitcher personalization** via residual correction models
2. **Expected outcome prediction** via pitch-type specific xwOBA regressors

### MoE Architecture
```python
# Training Phase
for pitcher in eligible_pitchers:  # ‚â•400 pitches
    moe_model = LightGBM(
        features=['count_state', 'prev_pt1', 'balls', 'strikes', 'stand', 'inning_topbot'],
        target=pitch_type_residuals,
        params={'num_leaves': 64, 'learning_rate': 0.1, 'num_boost_round': 200}
    )
    save(f"models/pitcher_moe/{pitcher}.lgb")

# Inference Phase  
base_logits = ensemble_predict(context)
if pitcher_model_exists:
    moe_residual = pitcher_model.predict(situational_context)
    final_logits = 0.85 * base_logits + 0.15 * softmax(moe_residual)
else:
    final_logits = base_logits  # graceful fallback
```

### xwOBA Architecture
```python
# Training Phase (per pitch type)
for pitch_type in ['FF', 'SL', 'CH', 'CU', 'SI', 'FC', 'FS', 'KC', 'OTHER']:
    xwoba_model = LightGBM(
        features=all_non_leaking_features,
        target=estimated_woba_using_speedangle,
        objective='regression',
        params={'num_leaves': 128, 'learning_rate': 0.05, 'num_boost_round': 400}
    )
    save(f"models/xwoba_by_pitch/{pitch_type}.lgb")

# Inference Phase
expected_xwoba = sum(
    final_probs[i] * xwoba_models[pitch_type].predict(context)
    for i, pitch_type in enumerate(pitch_types)
)
```

### Training Process
**Automatic Integration**: `run_full_pipeline.py` calls `scripts/train_moe_and_xwoba.py` after base models.

**Manual Training**:
```bash
python scripts/train_moe_and_xwoba.py --train-years 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
```

**MoE Requirements**:
- Minimum 400 pitches per pitcher for model eligibility
- Simple contextual features (no complex historical aggregations)
- 200 boosting rounds with early stopping

**xwOBA Requirements**:
- Minimum 500 samples with valid `estimated_woba_using_speedangle`
- All historical features except current-pitch markers
- 400 boosting rounds for better regression stability

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pitcher_moe_manifest.json   # Training metadata
```

### Performance Impact
**MoE Benefits**:
- +1-3 percentage point accuracy improvement
- Personalized adjustments for pitcher tendencies
- Robust fallback for pitchers without models

**xwOBA Benefits**:
- Expected outcome prediction with MAE <0.09
- Strategic value assessment beyond pitch type prediction
- Validation against actual Statcast xwOBA outcomes

### GPU Optimization
Both systems respect the `USE_GPU` environment variable:
```bash
GPU=1 python scripts/train_moe_and_xwoba.py --train-years 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
```

**GPU Parameters**:
- LightGBM: `device_type='gpu'` for both classification and regression
- Automatic fallback to CPU if GPU unavailable
- Training time: ~5-10 minutes on modern GPU vs ~20-30 minutes CPU

### Validation & Metrics
**Pipeline Integration Test**:
```python
# Automatic validation in run_full_pipeline.py
moe_applied = True  # reported in final metrics
xwoba_models = len(xwoba_models)  # count in output
expected_xwoba_mae = compute_mae(predicted, actual)  # if ground truth available
```

**Manual Validation**:
```bash
# Check MoE models exist
ls models/pitcher_moe/*.lgb | wc -l

# Check xwOBA models exist  
ls models/xwoba_by_pitch/*.lgb | wc -l

# Inspect training manifest
cat models/pitcher_moe_manifest.json
```

### Production Considerations
**Memory Usage**:
- MoE models: ~20KB √ó 400 pitchers = ~8MB total
- xwOBA models: ~10KB √ó 9 pitch types = ~90KB total
- Negligible memory overhead in production

**Inference Speed**:
- MoE lookup: O(1) dictionary access + single LightGBM prediction
- xwOBA calculation: 9 √ó single LightGBM predictions per pitch
- Total overhead: <1ms per pitch prediction

**Model Updates**:
- Retrain seasonally with new pitcher data
- xwOBA models more stable (yearly updates sufficient)
- Automatic model versioning via timestamp directories

### Cloud Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Transfer `models/pitcher_moe/` directory (~8MB)
- [ ] Transfer `models/xwoba_by_pitch/` directory (~90KB)
- [ ] Include `scripts/train_moe_and_xwoba.py` for retraining
- [ ] Set `USE_GPU=1` environment variable if GPU available
- [ ] Verify manifest file exists: `models/pitcher_moe_manifest.json`
- [ ] Test MoE integration with sample predictions
- [ ] Validate expected xwOBA calculation accuracy
